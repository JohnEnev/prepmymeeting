# OAuth Consent Screen Access Issue

## Current Status: BLOCKED ⛔

**Error:** `Error 403: access_denied - prepmymeeting.vercel.app has not completed the Google verification process`

## Problem

Google Cloud Console has a redirect bug that prevents access to the OAuth consent screen configuration page. This affects the ability to:
1. Add test users to the Testing mode app
2. Publish the app to allow unverified access
3. Submit for verification

## What We've Tried

### ✅ Attempted Solutions
- [x] Created new Google Cloud project (`prepmymeeting-prod`, ID: 1080837814019)
- [x] Fixed gcloud CLI (Python 3.13 → 3.11)
- [x] Tried gcloud IAP OAuth API (deprecated, requires organization)
- [x] Updated gcloud to latest version (543.0.0)
- [x] Multiple direct console URLs with project ID
- [x] Old console interface URLs
- [x] Incognito mode / different browsers

### ❌ Console Redirect Bug
All URLs redirect to: `https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview?project=prepmymeeting-prod`

### ❌ API Configuration
- No general API exists for OAuth consent screen configuration
- IAP OAuth API is deprecated (shutting down Jan 2026) and requires organization membership

## Current Setup

### OAuth Client Credentials
```
Project ID: prepmymeeting-prod
Project Number: 1080837814019
Client ID: 1080837814019-4mbsg9mr8f6bosl3iu1pnkge0eir4q4s.apps.googleusercontent.com
Client Secret: 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
Redirect URI: https://prepmymeeting.vercel.app/api/calendar/google/callback
```

### Environment Variables Set
- ✅ Local: `.env.local` updated
- ✅ Vercel: Production env vars updated
- ✅ Redeployed to production

### Code Status
- ✅ All OAuth integration code implemented
- ✅ Calendar fetching logic complete
- ✅ Cron job configured
- ✅ WhatsApp commands ready
- ✅ Database schema migrated
- ✅ Privacy policy and ToS created

## Solutions

### Option 1: Google Cloud Support (Recommended)
**File a support ticket:**
- URL: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_public_issue_form
- Request: Add `enevoldsen.j@gmail.com` as test user OR publish app
- Timeline: 1-3 business days

### Option 2: Wait for Bug Fix
Google console bugs sometimes get fixed without announcement. Check periodically.

### Option 3: Different Google Account
Try creating the project with a different Google account (may not have redirect bug).

### Option 4: Google Workspace Account
If you have access to a Google Workspace organization, create project there (more console features available).

## Direct URLs to Try

```
# OAuth Consent Screen
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=prepmymeeting-prod

# Old Console
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=prepmymeeting-prod

# Direct OAuth Client Edit
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/1080837814019-4mbsg9mr8f6bosl3iu1pnkge0eir4q4s.apps.googleusercontent.com?project=prepmymeeting-prod
```

## Testing When Unblocked

Once OAuth consent is configured, test with:

```bash
# Via WhatsApp
/connect_calendar

# Direct API test
https://prepmymeeting.vercel.app/api/calendar/google/auth?userId=test-123
```

## Expected User Experience (When Working)

### Testing Mode (Current)
1. User clicks OAuth link
2. Sees: "Google hasn't verified this app"
3. Clicks: "Advanced" → "Go to PrepMyMeeting (unsafe)"
4. Grants calendar.readonly permission
5. Redirected back with success

### Published Unverified Mode (After Publishing)
Same as above - still shows "unverified" warning

### Verified Mode (After Google Approval)
No warning - seamless OAuth flow

## Timeline

- **Now:** Feature complete but blocked by OAuth config
- **Next:** Contact Google Support or wait for bug fix
- **Later:** Once unblocked, test and potentially submit for verification

## What Works Without OAuth

The following features work fine:
- ✅ Meeting prep generation (without calendar integration)
- ✅ Voice notes
- ✅ WhatsApp/Telegram bot
- ✅ All non-calendar commands
- ✅ Manual meeting prep requests

## What's Blocked

- ❌ Automatic calendar event detection
- ❌ Proactive meeting notifications
- ❌ Calendar-based prep suggestions
- ❌ All `/connect_calendar` functionality
