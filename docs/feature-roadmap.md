# PrepMyMeeting Feature Roadmap

## Linear Issues - Next Steps

### 1. Natural Language Processing (High Priority)

**Title:** Add natural language understanding for meeting prep requests

**Description:**
Replace command-based interaction (/prep) with natural language processing. Users should be able to say things like:
- "I'm going to see a dermatologist, what should I ask?"
- "I have a contractor meeting tomorrow"
- "Preparing for a job interview"

**Implementation:**
- Use OpenAI to classify user intent from free text
- Detect meeting type (doctor, contractor, interview, etc.)
- Extract context from natural language
- Keep /commands as fallback for power users

**Technical Approach:**
1. Add intent classifier function using OpenAI
2. Parse entities (meeting type, date/time, context)
3. Route to appropriate handler based on intent
4. Update both Telegram and WhatsApp handlers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Bot responds to natural language requests without /prep command
- [ ] Correctly identifies meeting type from context
- [ ] Handles multiple phrasings ("seeing a doctor", "doctor appointment", "medical visit")
- [ ] Falls back gracefully when intent is unclear
- [ ] /prep command still works for backwards compatibility

**Estimate:** 5-8 hours
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ai`, `ux`

### 2. Conversational Feedback & Refinement (High Priority)

**Title:** Allow users to request refinements to generated checklists

**Description:**
Enable users to provide feedback and request modifications to generated content:
- "Make it shorter"
- "Less formal tone"
- "More detailed"
- "Focus more on budget questions"

**Implementation:**
- Store conversation context (last generated checklist)
- Use OpenAI with chat history to refine responses
- Support multiple rounds of refinement
- Clear context after new topic

**Technical Approach:**
1. Store last N messages in conversation context
2. Add refinement intent detection
3. Pass conversation history to OpenAI
4. Update stored checklist with refinement
5. Add "start over" or "new topic" detection

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I have a doctor appointment"
Bot: [generates checklist]
User: "Make it shorter and less formal"
Bot: [regenerates with adjustments]
User: "Perfect, thanks!"
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can request tone changes (formal, casual, friendly)
- [ ] Users can request length changes (shorter, longer, more detailed)
- [ ] Users can request focus changes ("more about budget", "focus on timeline")
- [ ] Bot maintains context for up to 5 message exchanges
- [ ] Bot detects when user wants to start a new topic

**Estimate:** 8-12 hours
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ai`, `conversation`

4. Pass to OpenAI with instructions
5. Save to `submitted_links` table
