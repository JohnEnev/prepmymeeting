## üìù Scope Justification

You'll need to explain why you need `calendar.readonly` scope:

**Template Response:**
```
Scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly

Justification:
PrepMyMeeting is a meeting preparation assistant that helps users prepare
for upcoming meetings by generating customized checklists. We need read-only
access to the user's Google Calendar to:

1. Detect upcoming events 24 hours in advance
2. Extract meeting details (title, description, attendees, time)
3. Send proactive preparation notifications via WhatsApp/Telegram
4. Generate context-aware prep suggestions based on meeting type

We ONLY read calendar data - we never create, modify, or delete events.
Users can disconnect at any time via the /disconnect_calendar command.

The calendar data is used solely to improve the user's meeting preparation
experience and is never shared with third parties (except OpenAI API for
generating prep suggestions, as disclosed in our Privacy Policy).
```

## üéØ Common Rejection Reasons (And How We Avoid Them)

### 1. ‚ùå "Privacy Policy doesn't explain calendar access"
‚úÖ **Our Fix:** Privacy Policy explicitly explains calendar.readonly scope

### 2. ‚ùå "Video doesn't show full OAuth flow"
‚úÖ **Our Fix:** Follow video script above showing complete flow

### 3. ‚ùå "Scope justification too vague"
‚úÖ **Our Fix:** Use detailed justification template above

### 4. ‚ùå "Privacy Policy not accessible"
‚úÖ **Our Fix:** Hosted at public URL, no login required

## üîÑ While Waiting for Approval

**Current Status:** App works in "Testing" mode

**Limitations:**
- Only test users can connect (up to 100)
- Shows "unverified app" warning

**Workarounds:**
1. Add users manually to test users list (if you can access consent screen)
2. Users can click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to app" to bypass warning
3. Share this with early users: "It's safe, just click through the warning"
